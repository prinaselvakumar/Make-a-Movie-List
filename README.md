# Make a Movie List
A top ten movie list generator built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OMDB and TMDB APIs

## Usage
When a user enters the name of a movie into the list, they are able to save it into the browserâ€™s local storage by clicking the "save" button. Then, the option to view more information about the saved movie is available by clicking the "movie" button. The movie's title and description are generated by the TMDB API, and the movie's poster and year are generated by the OMDB API.
